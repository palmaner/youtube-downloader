        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: May 11, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to YT Downloader ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our website and services (collectively, the "Service"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the service.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Service includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> When you use our Service, we automatically collect information about the YouTube video URLs you submit for downloading. This data is used solely for the purpose of providing the download service and is not stored long-term in association with any personally identifiable information. We may log the URL, requested format, and success/failure status for analytical and operational purposes (e.g., to monitor service health, identify popular formats, and troubleshoot issues). These logs are anonymized or aggregated where possible and are retained only as long as necessary for these purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Log File Information:</strong> Like many web services, we may log information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data. This information is used for system administration, to analyze trends, to track user movement around the site, and to gather demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information, except as necessary for security purposes (e.g., to prevent abuse of the service).</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We currently do not use cookies for tracking personal information. If we implement features that require cookies in the future (e.g., user preferences), this policy will be updated. Our service may use session-based cookies for essential site functionality, which are temporary and deleted when you close your browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Having accurate information permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Service to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and operate the Service.</li>
            <li>Process your download requests.</li>
            <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the Service.</li>
            <li>Maintain the security and integrity of our Service.</li>
            <li>Respond to user inquiries or provide support.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>We may disclose information we collect if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comply with a legal obligation or government request.</li>
            <li>Protect and defend our rights or property.</li>
            <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.</li>
            <li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.</li>
            <li>Protect against legal liability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If our service involves third-party service providers (e.g., hosting providers), they will only have access to your information as necessary to perform their functions and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>4. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Websites</h2>
        <p>The Service allows you to interface with YouTube, a third-party service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of YouTube or any other third-party services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third parties to understand their practices.</p>
         <p>Specifically, by using our service to download content from YouTube, you are also agreeing to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and Google Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Data Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. As we primarily process non-personally identifiable or temporarily held data for service operation, requests regarding personal data can be made to us, and we will address them as required by law. For any data stored by YouTube, you should refer to Google's data management tools and policies.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
