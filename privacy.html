        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: May 11, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to YT Downloader! We care about your privacy. This policy explains what information we handle when you use our website and service (our "Service"). If you don't agree with this policy, please don't use our Service.</p>

        <h2>What Information We Handle</h2>
        <p>When you use our Service, here's what we might collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Video URLs:</strong> When you paste a YouTube URL, we use it to get the download options for you. We don't store these URLs long-term with any info that identifies you personally. We might keep a temporary, anonymous record of URLs and requested formats to help our Service run smoothly and fix problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Info (Log Data):</strong> Like most websites, we automatically get some technical info. This includes things like your IP address, browser type, and when you used the Service. We use this to keep the Service working, see how it's being used, and for security. Your IP address isn't linked to you personally, unless it's needed for security (like stopping misuse).</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We don't currently use cookies to track you. If we use them later for basic site features (like remembering your settings), they'll be simple ones that usually disappear when you close your browser. We'll update this policy if that changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use This Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make our Service work for you.</li>
            <li>Handle your download requests.</li>
            <li>See how our Service is used so we can make it better.</li>
            <li>Keep our Service safe and secure.</li>
            <li>Answer your questions if you contact us.</li>
            <li>Follow any laws we need to.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We don't sell or rent your personal information to others for marketing.</p>
        <p>We might share information if the law requires it, or if we believe it's needed to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow a legal order or government request.</li>
            <li>Protect our rights or property.</li>
            <li>Investigate or prevent problems with the Service.</li>
            <li>Keep users or the public safe.</li>
            <li>Defend against legal claims.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we use other companies to help run our Service (like hosting), they'll only get the info they need to do their job and must keep it confidential.</p>

        <h2>Keeping Your Information Secure</h2>
        <p>We do our best to protect your information with reasonable security measures. However, no online service is 100% secure. We can't guarantee that bad actors won't find a way to intercept information. Anything you share online has some risk.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Websites (like YouTube)</h2>
        <p>Our Service connects with YouTube. This privacy policy only covers our Service. YouTube has its own privacy rules. When you use our Service to download from YouTube, you're also agreeing to YouTube's Terms of Service and Google's Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Check out YouTube's policies here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Terms of Service</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not for kids under 13 (or a similar age in your area). We don't knowingly collect info from children. If we find out we have, we'll remove it.</p>

        <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
        <p>We mostly handle data that doesn't identify you or is held only for a short time to make the service work. If you have questions about any personal data, contact us, and we'll respond as the law requires. For data YouTube has, see Google's policies.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We might update this policy. If we do, we'll post the new one here and change the "Last Updated" date. Please check back sometimes to see what's new. Changes take effect when posted here.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>Questions about this Privacy Policy? Please refer to the contact information available on our main service page or website.</p>
