        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: May 11, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the YT Downloader website (the "Service") operated by us ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>YT Downloader provides a web-based tool that allows users to input YouTube video URLs to fetch information and direct download links for those videos from YouTube's servers. The actual downloading of content occurs directly between the user's device and YouTube's servers. We do not host or store any copyrighted content on our servers.</p>

        <h2>2. User Responsibilities and Conduct</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone else's use and enjoyment of the Service.</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for the YouTube URLs you submit and for ensuring that you have the legal right to access and download the content from those URLs.</li>
            <li>You acknowledge that downloading copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder is illegal in many jurisdictions. You agree not to use the Service to download any content for which you do not have the necessary rights or permissions.</li>
            <li>You agree to comply with the YouTube Terms of Service (available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/t/terms</a>) as our service interfaces with YouTube. Failure to comply with YouTube's Terms of Service while using our Service is a violation of these Terms.</li>
            <li>You must not misuse our Service by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs, or other material that is malicious or technologically harmful.</li>
            <li>You must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to our Service, the server on which our Service is stored, or any server, computer, or database connected to our Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Service and its original content (excluding content from YouTube), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of YT Downloader and its licensors. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.</p>
        <p>We do not claim any ownership rights to the content downloaded from YouTube. All rights to such content are retained by their respective copyright holders.</p>

        <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the operation of our Service or the information, content, or materials included therein. You expressly agree that your use of the Service is at your sole risk.</p>
        <p>We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or that defects in the Service will be corrected. We do not warrant that the download links provided will always be functional or that the content downloaded will be of a certain quality or free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>
        <p>The availability of download links and formats is dependent on YouTube and may change without notice. We are not responsible for any changes or limitations imposed by YouTube.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall YT Downloader, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii.e) any content obtained from the Service (including content from YouTube); and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Our maximum liability to you for any cause whatsoever, and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to the amount paid, if any, by you to us for the Service during the term of use.</p>

        <h2>6. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless YT Downloader and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, or b) a breach of these Terms, or c) your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party, including but not limited to copyright infringement.</p>

        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>
        <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
