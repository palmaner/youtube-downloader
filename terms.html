        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: May 11, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>Hi there! These are the rules for using YT Downloader (our "Service"). When you use our Service, you agree to these rules. If you don't agree, please don't use the Service.</p>

        <h2>What Our Service Does</h2>
        <p>YT Downloader is a tool that helps you get download information for YouTube videos. You give us a YouTube URL, and we show you options from YouTube's servers. You download directly from YouTube, not from us. We don't store YouTube videos on our servers.</p>

        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use our Service legally and don't mess it up for others.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for the YouTube links you use. Make sure you have the right to download the content.</li>
            <li>Remember, downloading copyrighted stuff without permission is often illegal. Don't use our Service for that.</li>
            <li>You also need to follow YouTube's own rules (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Terms of Service</a>). Breaking their rules while using our Service also breaks our rules.</li>
            <li>Don't try to hack or harm our Service with viruses or other bad stuff.</li>
            <li>Don't try to access parts of our Service you're not supposed to.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Stuff (Intellectual Property)</h2>
        <p>Our Service, including our name, logo, and how it works (but not the YouTube content itself), belongs to us. Please don't use our brand without asking us first.</p>
        <p>We don't own the videos you download from YouTube. The rights to those belong to whoever owns the copyright.</p>

        <h2>No Guarantees (Disclaimer of Warranties)</h2>
        <p>We provide our Service "as is." That means we don't make any promises about it being perfect. It might not always work, be on time, be totally secure, or be error-free. Links might not always work, and quality depends on YouTube.</p>
        <p>YouTube can change how things work on their end, and we can't control that.</p>

        <h2>Limits on Our Responsibility (Limitation of Liability)</h2>
        <p>We are not responsible for any damages or losses you might have from using (or not being able to use) our Service. This includes problems with content you download from YouTube or if someone misuses our Service.</p>
        <p>If there is any issue where we are found responsible, the most we would be liable for is any amount you paid us to use the Service (if any).</p>

        <h2>If You Cause Problems (Indemnification)</h2>
        <p>If you do something that causes us legal trouble (like breaking these terms, breaking the law, or infringing on someone's copyright by misusing our service), you agree to cover our costs and damages, including legal fees.</p>

        <h2>Stopping Your Access</h2>
        <p>We can stop you from using our Service at any time, without warning, if you break these rules or for any other reason.</p>
        <p>Some parts of these rules will still apply even if your access is stopped (like rules about our stuff, no guarantees, limits on responsibility, etc.).</p>

        <h2>Which Law Applies</h2>
        <p>These terms are based on the laws of the State of California, United States. (Note: This is a placeholder; the actual location's laws that apply to you should be used.)</p>
        <p>If we don't enforce a part of these terms, it doesn't mean we give up that right. If a court says a part of these terms isn't valid, the rest still apply. These terms are the whole agreement between us about the Service.</p>

        <h2>Changes to These Rules</h2>
        <p>We might change these rules. If it's a big change, we'll try to let you know about 30 days before they happen. We decide what a "big change" is.</p>
        <p>If you keep using the Service after we change the rules, that means you agree to the new rules.</p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact us at: <a href="mailto:legal@ytdownloaderapp.example.com">legal@ytdownloaderapp.example.com</a>.</p>
